###Description:
In this project, I used only SQL to analyze pizza sales data. I used JOINs to connect different tables and find useful information like which pizzas sold the most and how customers ordered. This helped me practice SQL and understand how to work with multiple tables.


### Skills Used
- Basic SQL concepts  
- JOIN operations (combining tables)  
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT)  
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses  
- Data analysis using SQL
